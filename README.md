Personal Portfolio Website

 About Me:

Hi, I'm Sulfath — an aspiring full‑stack developer who loves building clean, responsive websites and experimenting with backend features. I enjoy learning by doing, and this portfolio is a way to show both my projects and my growth as a developer. My focus right now is on creating recruiter‑friendly, professional web experiences that highlight my skills in frontend polish and backend logic.
